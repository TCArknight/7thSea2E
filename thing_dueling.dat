    description="Aldana is the fighting Style of choice for many Castillians, one of the few fighting Styles on Théah that forgoes the use of the off-hand. Instead, the off-hand is tucked behind the Duelist's back and he presents his side to his opponent, narrowing the choice of targets that can be struck at. Aldana is designed for use with fencing weapons.{br}{br}Aldana combines fencing with dancing to produce an unpredictable series of movements. The Duelist silently counts time inside his head, mentally playing the song that he is 'dancing' to. This allows him to make unpredictable moves along with the rhythm of the song, which is unknown to his opponent."

    description="Ambrogia has caught on like wildfire in recent years. It is remarkable for two chief reasons. The first is that it teaches its students to fight with their sword in their left hand and their main gauche in their right. The second is that its creator, Veronica Ambrogia, also happens to be one of Vodacce's most famous courtesans.{br}{br}While Ambrogia does focus on the left hand (a factor that many Duelists find difficult to deal with), it emphasizes practicality over style. The students learn to use whatever they find in their hands to win the duel. 'After all,' teaches Madame Ambrogia, 'it's the winner who tells the tale.'"

    description="The Boucher Style of fighting was originally forged in the streets of Montaigne, and isn't considered a 'gentlemanly' school. However, some Duelists are more concerned with results than with the impression they make on their peers; this Style is designed with them in mind. Students of Boucher wield a long knife in each hand, and use the two together in a series of attacks designed to confuse and disorient the opponent.{br}{br}Boucher is one of the fastest fighting Styles taught on Théah today. Once the superior reach of the opponent's weapon has been overcome, the knife fighter starts a flurry of attacks that is almost impossible to stop."

    description="Created by Donovan Durant -- the most famous bodyguard in all of Théah -- this Style of swordplay is unique in both application and in the occupation of its creator. Donovan was very particular in those he took on as clients, only choosing to defend those who he truly believed needed protection. Before his retirement, it was said that only one ward under his protection ever died -- his first. He swore to never let it happen again. He kept that oath.{br}{br}Upon his retirement, he founded the Donovan Academy in Carleon, a school with perhaps the most rigid requirements for entry of them all. Every single student is approved personally by Donovan after a rigorous interview process. Only those who Donovan Durant judges to share his commitment to protection are permitted to study in his Academy."

    description="This school was developed by a mercenary named Kristoff Drexel, the leader of the warband known as the Blood Spirits. He often found himself in unpredictable situations that called for flexibility in thought and fighting Style. Thus, he devised several different ways to make use of the versatile Eisen zweihander. The Drexel fighting Style is very popular among elite mercenaries because of its ability to deal with many different situations.{br}{br}A Duelist making use of Drexel has more ways of attacking and defending himself than a Duelist using another Style. There are three Stances, or ways of holding the zweihander, that Drexel teaches. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages."

The Duelist deflects or grabs incoming attacks with his glove and exploits the openings created with his broadsword. Eisenfaust is defensive, teaching its students to wait for their opponent to make a mistake before attacking.{br}{br}Eisenfaust exploits mistakes made by an opponent. Gradually, the opponent grows impatient or angry. As soon as he slips up, the student of Eisenfaust is on top of him, raining down fearsome broadsword blows."

    description="Leegstra has been practiced by Vesten for centuries, well before it had a name or there was such a thing as the Duelist's Guild. This extremely aggressive Style teaches the use of a weapon in each hand, and encourages an almost reckless level of offense, seeking to suffocate opponents beneath a constant rain of blows.{br}{br}Although the method of fighting itself is old, it was only formalized around two decades ago by Leegstra Eldsdóttir, a Vesten woman who boasted that she had never been beaten in single combat. With the rise of the Duelist's Guilds, she founded her own Academy in the city of Thorshofn."

Many would-be Duelists have attempted to perfect a Style that uses something less conspicuous than a sword; Vito Mantovani chose the whip.{br}{br}The Mantovani Style favors misdirection and adaptability, using a whip to manipulate the environment: taking hold of small items to throw them at the opponent with the flick of a wrist or laying a small lash across the hand to make continuing to fight more pain than it is worth."

Her most famous performance was a captivating dance with a curved sword in each hand. Her act became so famous that it attracted the attention of the nobility and wealthy merchants, who would come from a hundred miles or more to see the famous Mireli Sword Dance.{br}{br}The Mireli Sword Academy is unique in that it has no set campus. Those who wish to learn it must find Mireli or one of her students as they travel from place to place, often amongst performers or circus troupes. This has been tradition for the Academy's nearly three decade long history."

He believed that many forms of strategy in chess could be applied to other strategies in life, from politics to warfare to swordplay. By twenty, he was considered by most to be a grand master, although it wasn't unknown for him to lose a match to an inferior opponent as he experimented with some unorthodox strategy.{br}{br}The Sabat school of fencing favors a defensive Style that allows opponents to attack relentlessly to exhaust themselves. Once the adversary is vulnerable, Sabat seeks to end the bout decisively and in one master stroke."

The student uses subtle movements to draw his opponent's attention to the cloak, and then blindside him with the rapier.{br}{br}The Torres school is an extremely effective defensive style, as the cloak and sword combine to form a wall of cloth and steel between the student and his opponent's blade. Masters of the school are some of the most quick-witted and agile men and women in the world."

    description="The Valroux Style of fighting is one of several that uses a fencing weapon in the primary hand and a main gauche in the off-hand. The fighting Style is technically defensive, with the main gauche used only to parry. Students of this Style call attention to openings they could have exploited, generally humiliate their opponents, and finish them off whenever the duel grows wearisome.{br}{br}One of the main strengths of this Style is its demoralizing effect on opponents. Masters of Valroux move the duel around in a dizzying circle, keeping their opponent guessing as to the pace of combat, all the while hurling insults that infuriate their adversary. To win against a student of the Valroux Style requires an iron will and long patience."
