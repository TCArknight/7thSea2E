<!-- This file contains the definition of the "static" form for the game system.
      The "static" form represents the region at the top of the main window that
      is always visible for every actor (hence the term "static"). It's an area of
      limited vertical height that spans the entire width of the main window, less
      the region needed for the validation button and the dashboard (if visible).

      In general, the "static" form should contain the character's name and core
      aspects of the character that the user will often want to refer to. However,
      there are no hard requirements for what is placed in the "static" form.

      NOTE! The unique id of the "static" form is specially recognized by Hero Lab
      as the form to be used across the top of the main window. A form with the
      id "static" is required within your data files.
