<!-- This file contains the definition of the "Special" tab panel. This tab is where
      the user can view a summary of all the special aspects of the character.

      All public visual elements used with this tab panel start with the prefix "sp"

  <!-- spSpecial portal
        Presents a fixed table consisting of all special traits for the character.

        The "list" element excludes all items that are designated as "hidden".

        We use a "headertitle" script to place a suitable title above the table.

        The "update" attribute is required so that the contents of this table are
        updated whenever changes are made elsewhere within the character that don't
        explicitly impact this table. For example, a special ability conferred by a
        race selection can be made at the top, and Hero Lab will normally assume
        the new race has no impact on the contents of this table. However, if the
        new race confers a special ability that needs to appear in this table, HL
        will assume there's no connection and not update this table. Using "update"
        forces HL to always update the table after any change to the character. This
        is expensive and should generally be avoided, so it should only be used in a
        situation like this where it is truly needed.

        This layout orchestrates the display of the visual elements that comprise
        the "Special" tab. This amounts to a title and a table that displays the
        itemsto the user.

        The logic for this layout is similar to preceeding tabs, so please refer
        to those tabs for more details.
