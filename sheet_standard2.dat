<!-- This file contains the definition of the second page of the standard character
      sheet for output. The second page is handled as a spillover sheet that will
      output any details that didn't fit on the first page. This is a technique that
      you will likely use for whatever game system you choose to support.

      The first page of the character sheet will be found in "sheet_standard1.dat".

      The portals used to output the equipment below are the same ones used on the
      first page of the character sheet. As such, those portals will be found in
      the file that defines the first page.

  <!-- oStandard2 layout
        This layout contains all the remaining armor, weapons, and gear for the
        character. If not all of the equipment can fit on the first sheet, the gear
        that remains is output on a spillover sheet. Spillover sheets continue to
        print as long as data remains that has not yet been output. This layout is
        designed so that it can be re-used for both the lefthand and righthand
        columns on the same sheet. So this layout shows all the armor it can, until
        it either runs out of armor or runs out of available space. Then it does
        the same for weapons, and finally for gear.

  <!-- standard2 sheet
        This is the second and subsequent page of the character sheet. It is a
        spillover sheet, so it is only printed when necessary and will continue to
        print as long as it remains necessary. The role of a spillover sheet is to
        output material that doesn't fit on previous pages, continuing to print
        until all items have been output. For this example, we allow the armor,
        weapons, and gear to spillover. However, spillover sheets are ideal for any
        data that can vary in length, such as spell lists, special abilities, etc.
        This particular sheet uses the same layout twice, using it for the left and
        right columns of output. You can have different layouts on this sheet, just
        like a standard character sheet, positioning them as you choose.
