<!-- This file contains the assortment of advantages for the game system.
      Abilities confer their effects through scripts that apply the necessary changes
      to the appropriate traits.

      Abilities influence traits, so all adjustments must be applied prior to when the
      final trait value is calculated. The script timing used below (PreTraits/5000)
      ensures that we satisfy this requirement. All abilities should be designated as
      "unique" so that they can only be selected a single time by the user.

    description="It is not enough to simply stop a Villain -- you must change her. The greatest weapon against wickedness is to take an agent of evil and make her a force for good. When you take a Risk in the direct pursuit of redeeming a Villain and turning her toward a path of Heroism, you can spend a Hero Point in place of spending a Raise for any Action. If an Action would require multiple Raises (because of Improvisation, being Unskilled, being under Pressure, etc.) you only need to spend one Hero Point to accomplish it. Because you are not spending Raises for these Actions, it remains your turn -- this means that, in effect, so long as you have Hero Points you can continue to take Actions back-to-back if every Action that you take is directly related to the redemption of a Villain.">
