  <!-- arMelee portal
        Presents a dynamic table where the user can add melee weapons for the
        character.

        We use separate templates for selecting weapons and showing the weapons
        that have been chosen. Each of these appears further below.

        We use an "additem" script to simply prompt the user to add weapons.

        The "buytemplate" and "selltemplate" attributes automatically hook in the
        logic appropriate for buying and selling items for cash. When a "buytemplate"
        is specified, adding an item automatically shows the template in the lower
        right corner (beneath the description), allowing the user to control the
        purchase price. When a "selltemplate" is specified, the template is shown
        when the user clicks on the delete button, allowing the user to control the
        selling price and quantity for the item.

        We use a "candidate" tag expression to limit the choices the user can make.
        We don't want to include natural attacks as purchasable, so we omit them.
        In all other respects, the want the "candidate" tag expression to behave
        just like the "list" tag expression.

        We could specify a component of "WeapMelee" and achieve the same result,
        with one exception. For consistency and to eliminate any need for code
        duplication, all of the transaction logic for buying and selling gear is
        defined for the "Gear" component. HL invokes the buy/sell logic associated
        with the component specified, with none being invoked if the component does
        not specify the logic. Consequently, we have to specify the "Gear" component
        in order to ensure that all the buy/sell logic is invoked properly. This
        forces us to filter on the "WeapMelee" component in both the "list" and the
        "candidate" tag expressions.

        We use the default "description" behavior to generate the appropriate
        information for display to the user as a description when choosing melee
        weapons. This invokes the "Descript" procedure for the purpose.

        We use a "headertitle" script to place a suitable title above the table.

  <!-- arWpnThing template
        Derived from the SimpleItem template, this template includes the weapon
        damage and purchase cost. It is specifically for showing things for the
        user to select.

        It would be reasonable to assume that we could designate the range as a
        simple field-based label portal, but that won't work. If the weapon is a
        melee weapon, it won't have the range field, so you'll get run-time errors
        when Hero Lab tries to access the field associated with the portal. The
        solution is to use a script-based label that properly checks whether the
        weapon is ranged. If so, then the field can be safely accessed. If not,
        then the text is left as empty.

  <!-- armory layout
        This layout orchestrates the display of the visual elements that comprise
        the Armory tab. This amounts to three pairs of title and table so the user
        can add melee weapons, ranged weapons, and armor/shields.

        The interesting facet of this layout is that it contains three separate
        tables that can vary in height, depending on what the user chooses to add
        to the character. These tables need to adapt their sizes to make efficient
        use of the available space. The "position" script accomplishes this goal.

        The exact steps being taken are clearly commented within the script, but
        the basic strategy is pretty simple. First the portals at the top are
        position, then the armor/shields table is positioned at the bottom with
        only two items visible. The remaining space is calculated and shared
        between the two weapon tables. Once the weapons have been given as much
        space as they need, the armor/shields table is enlarged to take up any
        additional space that is leftover.

      ~net value will yield an actual GAP of one less. For example, if the bottom

      ~you add 10 to that position for the next portal, it starts on pixel 25, so
      ~pixel 25 is part of the next portal. That means that pixels 16 through 24

      ~factor this detail in when adjusting the space remaining by our gaps.

  <!-- armory panel
        This is the "Armory" panel shown within Hero Lab. Since we want this panel
        to appear first within the second grouping (equipment), we assign it an
        "order" of 210.

        The logic for this panel is similar to the logic for the preceeding panels,
        so please refer to those panels for more details.
