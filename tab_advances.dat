  <!-- adAdvances portal
        Presents a dynamic table where the user can add and adjust advances for the
        character.

        We use the "LargeItem" template for selecting the advances, since all we need
        is basic information. We use a custom template for showing the selected
        advances so that we can include an "edit" button to allow modification of the
        advances.

        We use an "additem" script to highlight whether more advances points can be
        assigned. This requires that we specify the "addthing" referenced in the
        script, which is the resource for tracking advances points.

        We use a "titlebar" script to replace the default title on the choose form
        with something that includes the summary information as helpful feedback to
        the user.

        We use a "headertitle" script to place a suitable title above the table. The
        title includes an indication of how many skill points have been utilized and
        how many remain, with appropriate color highlighting to prompt the user.
